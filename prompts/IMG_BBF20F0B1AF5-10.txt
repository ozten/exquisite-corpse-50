A surreal pencil sketch of a fantastical creature, the top third depicts the rough outline of a wolf or dog head with messy, sketchy shading. The middle section transitions into an organic, amorphous blob-like shape, almost resembling a cloud or smoky apparition. Chaotic, swirling tendrils emanate from the bottom of the form, spiraling outward like the roots or tentacles of some eldritch abomination, rendered in a scraggly, Edward Gorey-esque style.
