A giant mushroom cap, patterned with oval holes and lines, in the artistic style of Dr. Seuss. The mushroom stalk morphs into a swirling, skeletal snake or dragon body with ridged scales, winding down to clawed feet, reminiscent of the dark surrealism of H.R. Giger. The feet are bird-like with hooked talons, evoking the whimsical sketches of Quentin Blake.
