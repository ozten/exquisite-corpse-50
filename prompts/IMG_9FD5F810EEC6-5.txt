A surreal oil painting in the enigmatic, dream-like style of Salvador Dali:

The top third depicts a curving, elongated figure with pipe-like protrusions from the head, impossibly bending and twisting upwards, reminiscent of Dali's melting clocks. Wispy lines suggest motion and fluidity.

The middle section transitions to a rounded, bulbous skeleton-like torso with an exposed ribcage containing concentric oval shapes, evoking Dali's fascination with spirals and internal anatomical structures. Thin, spindly arms reach outwards.

The bottom transforms into a flowing skirt shape, billowing outwards with ruffled, organic edges that resemble crashing waves or windswept fabric folds, capturing Dali's love of movement and draping forms. The skirt rests upon an undefined curving base.

Rendered entirely in sketch-like, unfinished pencil linework on white paper, embracing surrealist automatism and free-flowing creativity. Unbound from realism to explore the subconscious and illogical dream realm through biomorphic abstraction, in the distinctive style of Salvador Dali.
