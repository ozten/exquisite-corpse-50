A whimsical, surreal painting in the sketchy, minimalist style of Saul Steinberg or Jean Cocteau. The top third features three playful, anthropomorphic mice or rodent heads floating above an ornate, ruffled vest or coat with curling lapels and buttons. The middle section transitions into an otherworldly plant or mushroom with spiraling, feathery textures emerging from a central stalk, echoing the swirls of the vest. The bottom portion resolves into curving, organic shapes suggesting shells or fossils, their forms defined by repetitive line work that gives them an engraved appearance and ties back to the linear, sketch-like rendering of the animal heads. The overall effect is an inventive, dream-like composite blending natural and imagined forms in a deceptively simple yet evocative style.
