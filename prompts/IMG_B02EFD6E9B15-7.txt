A surreal painting in the style of Jean Cocteau. The top third shows an abstracted female face with flowing hair that transforms into wavy, organic lines. The middle section depicts a dress-like shape composed of gestural, fluid lines resembling fabric folds and pleats. The bottom third consists of triangular, geometric shapes suggesting feet or a stand for the figure above. The entire painting is rendered in a minimalist, continuous line style with an ethereal, dreamlike quality.
