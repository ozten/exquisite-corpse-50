A pencil sketch of a fantastical creature with a bulbous eye and geometric patterning on the head, reminiscent of Picasso's surreal portraits, atop a female humanoid torso wearing a cropped sailor-style top with an anchor emblem, cinched at the waist, transitioning to curvy hips and strangely jointed legs covered in scale-like patterns, ending in clawed feet, all in the simplistic yet evocative line art style of Dr. Seuss illustrations.
