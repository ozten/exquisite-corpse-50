A detailed prompt for Flux image generation that captures the style and content of this painting:

The top third shows a person's head consisting of tangled, curly hair drawn with a single wavy line. The eyes are simple dots and the center of the head has a sign that says "hello mac" in a handwritten style, in the whimsical, minimalist ink painting style of Shel Silverstein.

The middle section depicts the figure sitting at a computer, with just a few simple lines sketching out the keyboard and monitor in front of them. Wavy lines convey a sense of mental energy or processing. The style shifts to be even more abstract and gestural, reminiscent of Saul Steinberg's playful line paintings.

In the bottom third, the computer wires transition into a jumble of blue stringy, ribbon-like lines that spread out and tangle together, forming an surreal, organic shape on the ground. This abstract shape contrasts with the representational elements above, evoking Picasso's single-line paintings and incorporating a dash of Dal√≠'s surrealism in the free-flowing, biomorphic forms.

The overall composition moves from a more recognizable scene to increasing abstraction, while maintaining a unified, minimalist pen and ink style throughout. The limited color palette of black and blue on white adds graphic punch.
