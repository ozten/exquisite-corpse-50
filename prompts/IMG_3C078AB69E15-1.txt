A whimsical painting, divided into thirds:

The top third depicts an expressive cartoonish face with large almond-shaped eyes reminiscent of those drawn by Disney animator Glen Keane. The eyes have long lashes and a mischievous glint. Sketchy eyebrows float above.

The middle section shows a bulbous nose and grinning mouth with a gap tooth, in the energetic scrawling style of Quentin Blake illustrations, full of personality and movement.

The bottom portion consists of a rounded, doughy body shape standing on thin bird-like legs and feet, surrounded by small sailboats, waves and fish. This area evokes the quirky characters and underwater scenes often present in the works of children's book illustrator Oliver Jeffers.

Unifying the composition is a sketchy, gestural painting style with an economy of line. The artwork has a light-hearted, storybook feel in the manner of pen and ink character concept art.
