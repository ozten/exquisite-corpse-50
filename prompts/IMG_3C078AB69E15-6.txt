A surreal painting in the whimsical, minimalist style of Saul Steinberg. The top third shows a bald, rotund head with wide, expressive eyes, arched brows and a goofy grin waving stubby arms. The middle transitions to a pear-shaped body with small, pointy breasts. In the bottom third, the figure stands on tall, spindly legs with knobby knees and pointed feet, standing atop a brick wall. The entire painting is rendered in a sketchy, gestural pencil line with an economy of detail, capturing the playful essence of the imaginary character.
