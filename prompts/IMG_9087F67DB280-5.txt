A surreal, disjointed painting in the style of Jean Dubuffet or Joan Mir√≥. The top third features a simplistic, almost childlike red line painting of a distorted face with raised eyebrows, concerned eyes, a gaping mouth showing teeth, and scribbled red hair. The middle section transitions to a more abstract, looser sketch of an amorphous curvy shape with two staring eyes. Wispy tendrils and scrawled lines emanate from the figure. The bottom third splits into two nude lower bodies with thin, sticklike legs that multiply and blend together in a chaotic, energetic tangle. The overall composition is unsettling, raw and primal, balancing cartoon-like whimsy with darker psychological undertones.
