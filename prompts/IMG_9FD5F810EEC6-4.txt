A surreal painting, in the style of Jean Dubuffet, featuring:

The top third depicting a bizarre, elongated creature head with large, almond-shaped eyes, a long snout with sharp teeth, and wispy hair-like strands emerging from the scalp. The lines are sketchy and loose.

The middle section transitioning into a more patterned, abstract form, with a scaly, serpentine body covered in small x-shaped markings. The creature's neck is long and winding.

The bottom third exploding into a splash of bright red scribbles and smears, resembling blood or viscera. The tail end of the creature dissolves into a flurry of erratic, energetic lines against the stark white background.
