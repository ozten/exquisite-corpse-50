A surreal painting in the style of Jean Cocteau, featuring:

The top third showing an abstract, ghostly figure with a rounded hooded head and cape-like shape, drawn with thin, delicate lines in purple ink on white paper.

The middle section depicting outstretched, skeletal angel wings formed from sketchy, layered brush strokes and a faintly visible pentagram symbol at the center.

The bottom third illustrating two elongated, bony legs and feet standing on tiptoe, rendered with finely detailed linework that captures the anatomical structure and suggests a sense of graceful, dance-like movement.
