Here is a detailed prompt to capture the style and content of this painting:

A surreal pencil sketch, in the style of Salvador Dali. The top third shows an abstract, geometric head with swirling lines and shapes forming facial features reminiscent of Picasso. The eyes are simple circles with pupils, the nose an arrow shape. Wavy lines radiate from the head.

The middle third transitions into a boxy torso with a gaping, jagged mouth. Dripping teardrop shapes float inside the body. Thin, wispy lines extend from the shoulders, evoking a sense of movement and energy.

The bottom third depicts boneless, tubular limbs curving and intertwining. The legs are amorphous, blob-like shapes twisting together. Toes branch off the feet like roots of a tree. The overall composition is dreamlike, disjointed and unsettling, blending biomorphic and geometric abstract elements.
