A surreal painting in the style of Jean Cocteau. The top third features a fantastical creature head with sharp, stylized features, wavy hair, and whimsical swirls and shapes emerging from the crown. The middle section depicts an elongated, sinuous neck and bare shoulders with minimalist linework. In the bottom third, abstract biomorphic shapes resembling clouds or organs flow organically, punctuated by staring eyes. The entire composition is rendered in a fluid, continuous line painting with subtle shading, evoking an avant-garde, surrealist sensibility.
