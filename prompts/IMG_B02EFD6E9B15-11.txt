The top third shows the back of a head with tousled, wavy hair rendered in sketchy, expressive pencil lines in the style of Egon Schiele.

The middle third depicts an elongated neck and shoulders fading into an abstract tangle of curving, overlapping shapes, reminiscent of Picasso's line paintings.

The bottom third features roughly sketched, disjointed bony structures suggesting a ribcage or hip bones, with an unfinished, gestural quality evocative of Alberto Giacometti's sculptures.

The overall composition is a surreal, disjointed portrait emphasizing contour and motion over realism, combining elements of Expressionism, Cubism and modern sculpture.
