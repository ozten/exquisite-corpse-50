A surreal painting in the style of Saul Steinberg. The top third shows a lumpy, textured head with stylized eyes and nose reminiscent of early Steinberg doodles. Coffeebeans float around the head, evoking a caffeinated state of mind.

The middle section reveals the neck as an elongated, angular form, shedding the lumpy organic quality of the head. Linear folds and creases define the structure, transitioning into a puffy, layered hamburger bun texture.

The bottom third completes the transformation, with the torso becoming a fringed, furry mass drooping down over stick-figure legs. The spindly limbs contrast the bulbous upper body. Shading suggests a furry surface and rounded forms, uniting the disparate parts into an eccentric, imaginative whole - unmistakably Steinberg in its wit and economy of line.
