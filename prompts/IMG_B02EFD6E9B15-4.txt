A surreal female figure drawn in a minimalist, continuous line style. The top third shows her canine head in profile, wearing a collar with a tag that says "Oop 76". Her eye is closed and her snout elongated.

The middle section depicts her nude torso from the front, with exaggerated, drooping breasts marked by simple oval shapes and dot nipples. Her navel is a swirling vortex.

The bottom third shows her legs bent in a seated position, but only rough shapes without feet. Scribbled tufts of pubic hair cover her crotch area. The ground beneath her is suggested with a quick, sketchy line.

The overall style is reminiscent of a spontaneous, gestural life painting by an artist like Egon Schiele, capturing the female form with raw, unrefined energy and focus on exaggerated erogenous features, while also incorporating surreal, animalistic elements in the style of a Max Ernst frottage or automatic painting.
