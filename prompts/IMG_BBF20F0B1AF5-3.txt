A detailed prompt for Flux based on this painting:

The top third shows the head of a distorted female figure, with arched eyebrows, long lashes, button nose and pursed lips, adorned with a cross necklace and curly hair, in a sketched, loose brushstroke style reminiscent of Picasso.

The middle section depicts an ample female torso wearing a pearl necklace, drawn with simple curving lines and two hearts for breasts, evoking the minimalist, provocative style of Matisse's line paintings.

The bottom third transforms into an abstract, jumbled scrawl of red text spelling out a name, contrasting sharply with the black and white figure above, calling to mind Basquiat's raw, graffiti-like approach.

The overall composition is an avant-garde, Surrealist mashup of clashing styles - refined portraiture, sensual minimalism, and chaotic neo-expressionism - by three masters of modern art, in pencil, brushstroke and street art aesthetics.
