Here is a prompt that captures the surreal, whimsical style of this painting in three parts:

A pencil sketch of a grinning, curvaceous humanoid figure with a bald head adorned with star sparkles and spiraling curls on the sides, reminiscent of Pablo Picasso's line paintings. The top third shows curling, wispy lines emanating from the head.

The middle section features a bulbous rectangular torso with square teeth bared in a wide grin, and tentacle-like limbs with spiraling swirls at the ends, in the quirky, dreamlike style of Joan Miró's biomorphic figures and simple shapes.

The bottom third shows fluid, undulating abstract lines in red and green ink, evocative of the free-flowing, spontaneous gestures in André Masson's automatic paintings.
