A surreal painting in the style of Keith Haring. The top third shows a whimsical green face with long flowing hair, wearing a hat that says "I'm so popular", drawn with thick, energetic lines and flat colors. The middle section depicts a muscular, shirtless torso with exaggerated abs and pecs, sketched loosely with thin, gestural lines. The bottom third features the lower body wearing jeans, the legs fading into sketchy, unfinished lines, with bare feet peeking out underneath. The overall composition is playful, disjointed and captures Haring's signature bold, graphic style and sense of movement.
