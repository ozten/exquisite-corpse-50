A stunning painting in graphite pencil, in the style of Egon Schiele. The top third shows a male figure's head, with closed eyes, furrowed brow and tousled hair, rendered in Schiele's signature raw, expressive line work. The middle third depicts a muscular bare torso with arms akimbo, shaded to accentuate the contours and musculature in Schiele's bold, modernist manner. The bottom third transitions into an intricately patterned skirt or fin-like structure with radiating lines and scalloped, layered segments, merging figurative and abstract elements in an avant-garde fashion characteristic of Schiele's boundary-pushing oeuvre.
