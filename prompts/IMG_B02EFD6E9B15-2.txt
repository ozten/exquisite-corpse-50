Here is a detailed prompt for generating an image in the style of this painting:

Imagine a whimsical monster character drawn in a loose, sketchy pencil style by a child. The monster's head is rectangular with two large square eyes and a simple wide grinning mouth filled with square teeth, in the sketchy style of Basquiat.

The monster's body has several wavy octopus-like tentacles covered in a reptilian scale pattern, drawn with lots of small scribbly pencil lines. A grid of barred windows spans across its torso as if it contains a caged creature inside, reminiscent of children's book illustrations.

The lower third shows the monster's clawed feet with three pointed toes on each, standing on a ground filled with twinkling star shapes drawn in a naive, doodled style as if by a young child just learning to draw.

The overall composition has an imaginative, playful quality as if springing from the unbridled creativity of a child's mind, with varying painting styles merging into a quirky, fantastical creature. Maintain the sketchy pencil line work throughout the image to capture the improvised feel.
