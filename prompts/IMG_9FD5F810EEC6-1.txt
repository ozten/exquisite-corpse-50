A spooky jack-o'-lantern styled head, with angular eyes and jagged mouth, labeled "Absolu + Mango 38% alcohol", in the style of Tim Burton. The neck and shoulders are formed by an organic, amorphous blob, textured and shaded to resemble crumpled fabric or melting wax, in the surrealist style of Salvador Dali. Below, disembodied hands or claws reminiscent of the sketchy, unsettling illustrations of Edward Gorey.
