Here is a detailed prompt capturing the style and content of this painting:

The top third shows a simplistic bird-like creature formed with minimal lines, with a pointed crown or crest on its head, and two small eyes and a beak, in the whimsical, childlike style of Jean Cocteau illustrations.

The middle section depicts an androgynous naked torso with thin, elongated limbs, small breasts and nipples, and a protruding navel, rendered with gestural lines reminiscent of Egon Schiele's expressive figure paintings.

The bottom third transforms into a mermaid-like tail with an ornate, curving fin, drawn with more elaborate, decorative linework evocative of Aubrey Beardsley's Art Nouveau illustrations.

The entire figure is composed against a blank white background, with different artistic styles fluidly merging together in an imaginative, surreal way to create a fantastical hybrid creature, in the spirit of paintings popularized by the Surrealist art movement.
