A surrealist painting in graphite, featuring in the top third: a volcano erupting on a tropical island with a lone palm tree, the plume transforming into a woman's head in profile with long, flowing hair. The middle third shows the midsection as two large, round buttocks. The bottom third depicts the legs as coiled springs or telephone cords ending in bare feet.

The overall style is reminiscent of Salvador Dalí, with its dream-like, illogical juxtapositions and anatomical distortions. The fluid, continuous linework and shading evokes a sense of motion and transformation between the disparate elements.
