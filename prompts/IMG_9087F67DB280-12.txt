A surrealistic painting in a rough pencil sketch style, divided into three distinct parts:

The top section features a boxy geometric head with simple square windows for eyes and a rectangular slot mouth. Extending from the top is a thin neck connected to an angular, house-like structure with a pitched roof.

The middle section depicts an armless, doll-like body with a rounded egg shape adorned with zigzag patterns resembling a knitted sweater. Thin, stilt-like legs extend down from the torso.

The bottom section shows comically large shoes or boots in a chunky, cartoonish style with prominent stitching and curved soles.

The overall composition has an imaginative, playful quality reminiscent of illustrations by Shel Silverstein or Maurice Sendak, with a touch of Basquiat's raw, graffiti-esque linework. The contrast between geometric and organic shapes, along with the disproportionate anatomy, adds to the whimsical and dreamlike nature of the character design.
