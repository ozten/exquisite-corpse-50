A surreal painting in the style of Salvador Dali. The top third shows a round cartoonish head with large round glasses, sketchy curled hair, and mechanical gears visible inside the head. The middle third depicts an hourglass female figure in a flowing dress or robe, with arms outstretched. The bottom third transitions into amorphous biomorphic shapes and curves suggestive of a seated or kneeling figure. The entire composition is rendered in a scribbly, gestural pencil sketch aesthetic on white paper.
