A surreal painting in the style of Tim Burton. The top section features an expressive, googly-eyed monster head with wild, unkempt hair and a wide, toothy grin. The middle section depicts a simple rectangular body with "SNATCH" written on it and arrow pointing downwards. The bottom section shows the monster's lower half as winding, swirling tentacles or roots spreading out below.
