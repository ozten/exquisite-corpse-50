A crocodile or dinosaur-like creature drawn in a sketchy, pencil style. The top third shows the head, with a speech bubble asking "I are Austin?". The creature has large eyes, sharp teeth, and a spiky head.

The middle section depicts the torso, with a zig-zag spine or plates running down the back. Anatomical labels like "ribs", "flank", "asshole" point to various body parts. The sketch lines are loose and gestural.

The bottom third illustrates the legs, tail, and underside. The legs are bent, with claws or toes detailed. The tail curls up behind the animal. Shading suggests shadows and dimension.
