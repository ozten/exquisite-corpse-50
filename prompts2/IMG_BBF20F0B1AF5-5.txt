An oil painting by Salvador Dali, depicting a young girl with a large head and small body, wearing a dress made of pieces of paper stitched together. Her eyes are wide and haunting, her mouth agape. Her legs are thin and wobbly, ending in roller skates. The background is a stark, empty white space, emphasizing the surreal and unsettling nature of the figure.
