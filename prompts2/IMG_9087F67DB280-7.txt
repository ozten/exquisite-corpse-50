An oil painting by Salvador Dali depicting towering palm trees with swirling, curving trunks against a stark white background. The trees cast shadowy, distorted reflections on the ground, echoing the surreal, dreamlike atmosphere. In the foreground, an architectural structure with thin, spindly legs stands precariously, adding to the sense of instability and illusion in the composition.
