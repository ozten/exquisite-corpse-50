Create an oil painting in the style of Salvador Dali featuring a nude female figure with exaggerated, voluptuous curves and breasts. The figure's face should be obscured, represented by a wolf or dog-like head. Incorporate surreal, dream-like elements such as melting clocks draped over the figure's body and a barren, desert landscape in the background. Use a muted, earthy color palette to convey a sense of mystery and eroticism.
