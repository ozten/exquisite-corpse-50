An oil painting by Salvador Dal√≠ depicting a bizarre, distorted human figure with exaggerated facial features, bug eyes, and a comically large, gaping mouth. The figure's body is distorted and misshapen, with elongated limbs and bulging muscles. The background is a surreal, dreamlike landscape with melting clocks, abstract shapes, and strange creatures floating in the sky. The overall mood is unsettling and absurd, capturing the themes of distortion, exaggeration, and the subconscious mind.
