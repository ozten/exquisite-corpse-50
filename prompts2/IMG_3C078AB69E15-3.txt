Create an oil painting in the style of Hieronymus Bosch depicting a fantastical scene with anthropomorphic creatures. Include a menacing wolf-like creature with sharp teeth looming over smaller, anxious humanoid figures with bulbous heads and exaggerated facial features. Incorporate swirling, tentacle-like shapes in the background to heighten the sense of unease and surrealism in the composition.
