Create an oil painting in the style of Salvador Dali featuring a humanoid female figure with elongated limbs and torso, emerging from swirling, organic cloud-like shapes. The figure's head is a giant sunflower with a single eye in the center, gazing outward. Surrounding the central figure are floating abstracted faces and eyes, disembodied and dream-like. The overall composition is vertically oriented with an ethereal, flowing quality, blending the boundaries between the body and the atmospheric background.
