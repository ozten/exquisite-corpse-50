Create a surrealist oil painting in the style of Salvador Dali depicting a nude female torso with exposed breasts and a necklace of strange symbols around her neck. Her head is replaced by a bizarre distorted face with bulging eyes, a gaping mouth, and tangled hair. The background is an empty white void, emphasizing the unsettling distortions and juxtapositions of the human form. The colors should be muted earth tones with hints of red to evoke an eerie, dreamlike atmosphere.
