An oil painting by Salvador Dali featuring a distorted, elongated figure with a transparent rib cage revealing a hidden keyhole. The figure is standing on a surreal, rocky landscape with bent and twisted tree branches reaching out. The painting captures themes of inner secrets, transformation, and the merging of the internal and external worlds in a dreamlike, hallucinatory style.
