An oil painting by Max Ernst in his surrealist style depicting a biomechanical bird with large mushroom cap feet, gear-like eyes, and metallic wings sprouting from a mass of tangled roots or vines, set against a stark white background. The painting should capture the unsettling fusion of organic and mechanical elements in a detailed, precisely rendered manner characteristic of Ernst's work.
