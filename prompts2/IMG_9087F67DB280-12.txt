Create an oil painting in the style of Salvador Dali depicting a robotic angel figure with a boxy, mechanical body and sweeping, feathered wings. The angel's face should be an intricate geometric pattern resembling a circuit board. Place this surreal robotic angel against a stark, minimalistic background with subtle mathematical symbols and equations floating in the space around it, evoking a sense of the strange juxtaposition between the spiritual and the technological.
