An oil painting by Salvador Dal√≠ depicting a surreal, elongated creature with a comical expression, exaggerated facial features including large eyes and a bewildered stare, curvy lines delineating its unusual anatomy, and bright red heart shapes on its pink body, standing on spindly green legs with untied shoelaces, evoking themes of childlike wonder, metamorphosis, and the irrational.
