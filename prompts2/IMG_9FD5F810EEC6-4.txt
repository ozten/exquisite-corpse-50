An oil painting by Ren√© Magritte depicting a giant disembodied head with crocodile or alligator jaws devouring a human figure, rendered in Magritte's signature surrealist style with a limited color palette of red and black against a stark white background, exploring themes of consumption, transformation, the blurring of boundaries between human and animal, and the subconscious mind.
