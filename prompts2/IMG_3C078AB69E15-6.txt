A surreal oil painting by Ren√© Magritte depicting an enormous, rotund female figure looming over a brick wall, her body distorted and exaggerated with oversized breasts and belly. The figure's arms are comically small, waving in a playful gesture, while her face bears a simple, cartoonish expression with wide eyes and a smiling mouth. The stark contrast between the figure's immense size and the tiny, fragile wall beneath her creates an unsettling and dreamlike atmosphere, challenging the viewer's perception of reality and exploring themes of scale, absurdity, and the subconscious mind.
