A surrealist oil painting by Leonora Carrington featuring a group of anthropomorphic rats sitting on top of a mound. The rats have exaggerated swirling tails and are wearing Victorian-style clothing. In the background, there are abstract spiral shapes resembling architectural elements. The overall composition has an unsettling and dreamlike quality, with a focus on the juxtaposition of the familiar and the bizarre.
