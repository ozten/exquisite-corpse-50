An oil painting by Salvador Dali featuring a surreal, anthropomorphic figure with exaggerated facial features such as large, expressive eyes and a gaping mouth. The figure is voluptuous and curvaceous, standing in a desolate, dreamlike landscape with small, stylized sailboats in the distance, capturing themes of emotion, desire, and the subconscious mind.
