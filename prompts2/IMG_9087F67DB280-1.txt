A surreal oil painting by Salvador Dali featuring a towering, distorted humanoid head emerging from a layered, textured hamburger bun landscape. The head has exaggerated, elongated features and hollow, staring eyes. Floating coffee beans hover in the sky around the head, adding an element of absurdity and symbolism. The overall composition is dreamlike, unsettling, and thought-provoking, exploring themes of consumption, identity, and the subconscious mind.
