A surrealist oil painting by Rene Magritte in his signature style, depicting a giant anthropomorphic figure with an oversized head made of intricate curling tendrils and a wide grinning mouth full of teeth. The figure stands on abstracted, undulating legs against a stark white background, evoking themes of the subconscious, dreams and the absurd juxtaposition of the familiar and the bizarre.
