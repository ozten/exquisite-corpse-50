An oil painting by Yves Tanguy featuring biomorphic, tendril-like forms emerging from two melting, ghostly figures. The curving organic shapes are adorned with small red spots, suggestive of disease or corruption. Set against a stark white background, the surreal, unsettling forms convey themes of decay, mutation and the uncanny merging of the biological and the abstract.
