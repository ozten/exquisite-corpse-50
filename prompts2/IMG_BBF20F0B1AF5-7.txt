An oil painting by Salvador Dal√≠ depicting a fantastical humanoid figure with elongated limbs, distorted anatomy, and surreal protrusions emerging from the skin. The figure's pose conveys a sense of vulnerability and exposure, while the tangled, organic lines suggest inner turmoil and psychological complexity. The monochromatic palette and blank background heighten the dreamlike, introspective atmosphere.
