Create an oil painting in the style of Yves Tanguy depicting a surreal landscape with biomorphic shapes resembling distorted body parts. The composition should feature elongated, undulating forms that merge together, with protrusions resembling feet or claws. The central mass should have a textured surface reminiscent of scales or armor. Use a muted, monochromatic color palette to enhance the unsettling and dreamlike atmosphere.
