Oil painting by Salvador Dal√≠ depicting a fantastical creature with an elongated neck, jagged teeth, and expressive single eye. The body is dissected to reveal inner anatomical structures like ribs, flank and asshole. Surround the creature with a desolate, dreamlike landscape and handwritten notes suggesting themes of self-analysis and questioning reality vs. angst.
