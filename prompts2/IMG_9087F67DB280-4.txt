Create an oil painting in the style of Salvador Dali depicting a monstrous, surreal creature composed of a giant cup of steaming liquid labeled "FUN GI", with a distorted, monstrous face emerging from the steam rising out of the cup, its exaggerated features melting and dripping down. The creature sits hunched over on spindly legs made of tangled roots or tentacles.
