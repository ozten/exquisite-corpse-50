In the style of Rene Magritte, create a surrealist oil painting featuring a large, disembodied green humanoid figure with exaggerated muscles and simplified facial features. The figure's eyes should be replaced with red bike reflectors, giving an unsettling, robotic appearance. The background should be a stark white, emphasizing the figure's isolation and detachment from reality. Incorporate Magritte's signature themes of distorted scale and unexpected juxtapositions to heighten the sense of surrealism and unease in the painting.
