A photorealistic oil painting by Salvador Dali depicting a headless male figure, the torso muscular and rippling, wearing an ornate patterned belt. The figure's missing head is replaced by a floating, disembodied face with closed eyes and a mustache, hovering ethereally above the neck. The surreal juxtaposition suggests themes of displacement, dissociation of mind and body, and the mysteries of identity and consciousness.
