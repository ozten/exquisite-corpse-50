Here is a detailed prompt to generate a new exquisite corpse style drawing using Flux:

Upper third:
Draw an alien-like head with large, expressive almond-shaped eyes. Include small curly lashes and irises shaded to look reflective. Add a simple smiling mouth below the eyes. Frame the head with leaf or feather-like protrusions on either side. Use minimal shading and keep the style cartoonish and whimsical.

Middle third:
Sketch an exaggerated curvy feminine torso, with an extremely thin waist that flares out into wide hips. Keep the lines loose and gestural. Add two teardrop shapes to represent simplified breasts. In the center of the torso, draw a ghostly skull shape, shaded lightly to give an ethereal, x-ray like effect. Maintain the playful, hand-drawn aesthetic.

Lower third:
Transition the wide hips into two chubby legs and feet, bent in a jaunty, playful stance. Sketch the feet as simple triangular shapes. Add three wispy tufts of grass-like hairs sticking up from each foot. Again, use light, gestural linework to continue the surreal, doodled style that unifies the disparate parts. Finally, place a few sailboats floating whimsically near the feet to enhance the dreamlike, nonsensical feel of the composition.

Sketch the final exquisite corpse drawing in graphite or charcoal, embracing wobbly, imperfect linework to capture the spontaneous, surreal spirit. Aim for an uncanny, playful mashup of diverse visual elements.
